        I hold a Dual Bachelor’s in Software Engineering (2018-2022) and a
        Master’s in Business Administration (2022-2023) from Staffordshire
        University & Asia Pacific University. With over three years of web
        development experience, I specialize in front-end technologies. As a Web
        Developer/Team Lead at Admin Apspace, I led the migration of legacy
        systems into a new Angular-based web app, developed APIs using Flask,
        and managed a team of four developers. In my prior role at the
        Multisites team, I built automated workflows and responsive websites
        using WordPress, PHP, and JavaScript.
